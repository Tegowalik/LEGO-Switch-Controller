# Pybricks Switch Controller
Automate your LEGO train tracks by randomly change the direction of switches by detecting incoming trains. An example usage is presented here: https://youtu.be/EsnzuTQ5WIw?t=199

In principle, all the programs work in the same way: Trains are detected by an distance sensor which causes the switch to change direction (at least with some probability). Depending on the used hardware components (Powered Up City Hub/ Technic Hub, MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor 51515, MINDSTORMS EV3 31313, Spike Prime) different programs are required as explained later in detail.

Most of the provided programs are running [PyBricks](https://pybricks.com/) code. However, for LEGO MINDSTORMs EV3 (31313) [EV3 MicroPython](https://pybricks.com/ev3-micropython/) is used. The LEGO MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor (51515) can be used either with PyBricks or with the official [LEGO MINDSTORMS Software with Python Programming](https://lego.github.io/MINDSTORMS-Robot-Inventor-hub-API/).

To get the motor rotation change the direction of the switch, a design of [SteinaufStein](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ-c1vQHVZZ6S6xhjjNo7Gg) is used ([video tutorial](https://youtu.be/Jwv6kI0IBoQ?t=63)). Note that for some powered up motors an additional gear ration is needed since the motors are too weak to move the switch position.

## Powered Up Hubs
All the programs for powered up hubs are running [PyBricks](https://pybricks.com/) code. The following description uses some PyBricks specific terms, so read their [documentation](https://docs.pybricks.com/en/stable/) to understand details. Also refer to [here](https://code.pybricks.com/) in order to actually run the provided python code on your powered up hubs.

For controlling the switches, you can use any type of motor with rotation sensor being compatible with the powered up system. The following picture from the (PyBricks Documentation](https://docs.pybricks.com/en/latest/pupdevices/index.html) shows the compatible motors.
<img src="img/motors.jpg" width="600">
These motors occur in motorized LEGO Technic Sets (like Liebherr R 9800 Excavator (42100), App-Controlled CatÂ® D11 Bulldozer (42131)) and in LEGO MINDSTORMS/ SPIKE sets (like Robot Inventor (51515), SPIKE Prime Set (45678)). 

As sensor any sensor which can determine a distance is possible. The pictures are again taken from the (PyBricks Documentation](https://docs.pybricks.com/en/latest/pupdevices/index.html).

Since all sensors except the Color & Distance Sensor are used only in MINDSTORMS/ SPIKE sets (which are EOL 2022), the Color & Distance Sensor seems to be the most suitable - also because it is sold individually by LEGO and is relatively cheap.

Once you have organized the hub, motor(s) and sensor(s), you are ready to run the program. Therefore you need a hub dependant *code basis* and a switch layout dependant *configuration part*.

### Powered Up Code Basis
| City Hub | [CityHub.py](CityHub.py) |
|-|-|
| Technic Hub | [TechnicHub.py](TechnicHub.py) |

### Powered Up Configuration Part
Depending on your actual switch layout, you need to add a few lines to the program right below the line `# configure your switch layout here`.

The following examples should cover the most important switch-sensor-motor-combinations. You might need to make little changes (like changing the used sensor type, port or parameter values). Note that depending on your specific train layout some parameters might need to be adjusted as explained in the [Special Features](#powered-up-special-features) section.

Note that for the [City Hub](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/hub-88009) (the hub used for the City trains), only the first example can be used since only two ports are available (see [here](examples/CityHub_1.py)). In particular, another special program is available for this case which is easier to understand (esspecially if you are not familiar with object oriented programming): [CityHub_easy.py](CityHub_easy.py).

Personally, I recommend to first running the program without including the current program to the hub's firmware. So you can easily experiment different settings and see what fits your purposes best (errors can be seen in the terminal). Once the program is ready, flash the hub and include the current program to the firmware (Currently this option is available under "Settings" -> "Firmware" -> "Include current program"). This causes that the flashed program is executed whenever the hub is started in the future - unless you reflash it again. You can easily reflash the original LEGO firmware by connecting the hub to the powered up app. The disadvantage of flashing the program to the firmware is that you can no longer see the terminal output, so make sure that the program runs without errors before doing this.

### Powered Up Special Features
- **Colors**:
  - `RED`: Switch is currently moving the direction. No train should now be passing the switch! Otherwise derailments could occur!
  - `ORANGE`: Currently a switch is detected in front of the sensor
  - `YELLOW`: Currently no train is in front of the sensor, but a train was detected a short time ago (so either the transition of two wagons is in front of the sensor or the train passed completely the sensor a short time ago)
  - `GREEN`: otherwise (sensor is waiting for an incoming train)
  - In case of a program with multiple sensors, the first color in the list is shown whose condition is true for at least one sensor
- **Power Off**: Use the green button of the hub to power the controller off. This might cause resetting the switches to the initial state.
- **Probabilities**: The constructor `SwitchMotor` has the optional parameters `probability_straigth_to_curved` and `probability_curved_to_straigth` (default value `0.5` each). The default configuration means, that the motor moves on average after every second train. Setting both parameter to `1.0` means that the motor moves at every train. Setting `probability_straigth_to_curved < probability_curved_to_straigth` means that the motor is more often in the *straight* position.
```python
  motor = SwitchMotor(Port.B, probability_straigth_to_curved=0.5, probability_curved_to_straigth=0.8)
```
- **Motor Auto Calibration**: Of course the `SwitchMotor` needs to know what motor positions correspond to which `SwitchPosition` (either `STRAIGHT` or `CURVED`). This is achieved by 
  - the parameter `switchPosition` in it's constructor which states the initial `SwitchPosition` (default is `STRAIGHT`)
  ```python
    motor = SwitchMotor(Port.B, switchPosition=SwitchPosition.CURVED)
  ```
  - an information how much the motor needs to move to get to the other position. This can be achieved by the parameter `turn_degrees` which is equal to the degrees from the initial position to the other. However it is really complicated to figure out the right number (depends obviously on the gear ratio, ...). If `turn_degrees` is None (as it is by default), an auto calibration is done i.e. the motor moves left and right until the motor stalls. Make sure that the motor is connected to the switch otherwise it would move forever!
  ```python
    motor1 = SwitchMotor(Port.B, turn_degrees=100) # fixed degrees
    motor2 = SwitchMotor(Port.C, turn_degrees=None) # auto calibration
  ```
- **Distance Sensors**: As described above multiple distance sensors are supported: `SwitchDistanceSensor`, `SwitchIRSensor`, `SwitchUltrasonicSensor`, `SwitchColorSensor`. All sensors have a parameter `criticalDistance` which refers to the distance from which the sensor should be triggered (detect a train). A larger `criticalDistance` means that also objects further away are recognized. Default values are given for each sensor type, but the perfect value for you might depend on the sensors's positioning and the lightning conditions. For me, the `SwitchDistanceSensor` works the most reliable.
 ```python
  sensor = SwitchDistanceSensor(Port.A, criticalDistance=50) # critical distance in %
  sensor = SwitchIRSensor(Port.B, criticalDistance=80) # critical distance in %
  sensor = SwitchUltrasonicSensor(Port.C, criticalDistance=400) # critica distance in mm
  sensor = SwitchColorSensor(Port.D, criticalDistance=70) # critical distance in %
 ```
 - **Timeout**: Since the sensor usually does not trigger for the whole time a train is passing by (e.g. between two train trailers), a timeout is used to skip those gaps. Additionally, the timeout is needed if the motor moves *after* a train has passed. In that case the train still needs some time to pass the (last) switch (distance from sensor to the last switch). The length of the `timeout` can be set by using `sensor.set_init_timeout(40)` where 40 is the timeout value (also the default value). Note that the meaning of the timeout value depends on the `dt`-value (time in ms between two ticks) of the SwitchController. The default `dt`-value of 50ms combined with an timeout of 40 means that after 40 * 50ms = 2s without sensor triggering a train is considered to be passed completely.
- **Rising/ Falling Edge** Two options when the switch moves are provided: The motor moves right when an incoming train is detected (`SwitchMode.RISING_EDGE`) or after a train has passed the sensor (and switch) completely (`SwitchMode.FALLING_EDGE`). The option can be set by using `sensor.set_switch_mode(SwitchMode.RISING_EDGE)`. However, I can only recommend using `SwitchMode.FALLING_EDGE` (default value) since the powered up motors seem to be too weak/ slow (the moving of the motor takes too long). Unless the distance between the sensor and the switch isn't far and/ or the trains are driving slow, the rising edge mode didn't work for me reliable with powered up motors. By the way the MINDSTORMS EV3 motors work with the rising edge mode.
```
  sensor = SwitchDistanceSensor(Port.A)
  sensor.set_switch_mode(SwitchMode.RISING_EDGE)
```

## MINDSTORMS (Robot Inventor 51515, SPIKE Prime 45678)
The [PyBricks](https://pybricks.com/) code for these hubs works similar to the ones using the Powered Up Hubs. You just need to use the special code basis: [MINDSTORMS_51515.py](MINDSTORMS_51515.py). (I haven't tested it for the SPIKE Prime, but according to the PyBricks documentation, the code should work as well).

> Currently, these hubs are only supported by the PyBricks beta, so make sure to use the right app: [https://beta.pybricks.com/](https://beta.pybricks.com/).

Using the MINDSTORMS code basis, all [Powered Up Configuration Examples](#powered-up-configuration-part) can also be used for the MINDSTORMS Hubs. But because of the additional available ports, even more (complex) configurations become possible. Again you need to add the few lines to the program right below the line `# configure your switch layout here`.

In case you don't want to flash your MINDSTORMS with PyBricks firmware, you can still use a version for the official LEGO Mindstorms Software with Python Programming: [MINDSTORMS_51515.lms](MINDSTORMS_51515.lms)/ [MINDSTORMS_51515_LEGO_python.py](MINDSTORMS_51515_LEGO_python.py). However, because of the very limited functionality of the programming language, only a 1 Switch + 1 Motor layout is provided (with less modification possibilities compared to the PyBricks version). 

### Special Features
Additionally to the [Powered Up Hub Speical Features](#powered_up_special_features) the light matrix is used to indicate the progress of the sensor timeout. Depending on the number of sensors the color matrix shows progress bar(s) indicating the timeout progress. If a motor is currently moving, the color matrix shows a cross ('x') additionally to the red light.

## MINDSTORMS EV3 (31313)
To run python programs on an EV3, you first need to follow these [instructions](https://pybricks.com/install/mindstorms-ev3/installation/). After that you can use the following programs:

|Description | Image | Program |
|-|-|-|
|2 Sensors + 2 XL Motors | | [program](ev3_switch_1_1_XL_XL.py)|
|1 Sensor + 2 XL Motors | <img src="img/ev3_1_1.jpg" width="350">| [program](ev3_switch_2_XL_XL.py)|
|2 Sensors + 2 XL Motors + 1 M Motor |  <img src="img/ev3_2_1.jpg" width="350">| [program](ev3_switch_2_1_XL_M_XL.py)|

Of course not all possible combinations of sensors and motors are provided. In addition the programs aren't that flexible as the PyBricks ones. However the basic idea how to adjust the code for a certain sensor-motor-layout should be obvious.

## Known Issues
- The variable/ method naming in the python files mixes CamelCasing and snake_casing. As a programmer, I really regret that I haven't been consistently using a case system. However I don't have neither the time nor the motivation to make the naming consistent.
- Some pictures of configurations are missing
- As soon as communication between hubs is possible, this makes a lot of new features possible (large chained layouts are possible -> no limitation due to limited available ports). Furthermore, it would be awesome if PyBricks Hubs could connect to a app which supervises *all* hubs.

If you find any unexpected behaviour or have a feature request, please create an issue or a pull request.

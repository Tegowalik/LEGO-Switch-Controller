# Pybricks Switch Controller
Automate your LEGO train tracks by randomly change the direction of switches by detecting incoming trains. An example usage is presented here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsnzuTQ5WIw&t=317s 

In principle, all the programs work in the same way: Trains are detected by an distance sensor which causes the switch to change direction (at least with some probability). The reason for the different program files consists in
- the different hardware components (powered up City Hub/ Technic Hub, Mindstorms Hub 51515, Mindstorms EV3 31313)
- the different possible switch layouts (1 sensor + 1 switch, 1 sensor + 2 switches in a row, 2 sensors with 1 switch each, ...).

Unfortunately depending on the harware type, different ways of programming is required.
